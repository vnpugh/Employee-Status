# Employee Status
Java Encapsulation <br>
<h3>Learning Objective</h3>
<p>This activity demonstrates how encapsulation is used in Java. The program will display 
the employee's name, employee_id, department, and full-time status (boolean = true). Two Java clases (src) were created, Main and Employee.
Also, getter and setter methods are used to access the private variables.</p>

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data (variables and methods) under a single unit. The variables of a class will be hidden from
the other classes, and can only be accessed through the members of the current class. In other words, this OOP method acts as 
a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
<h3>The Elements Needed for Encapsulation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Declare the variables of a class private.</li>
  <li>Create getter and setter methods to modify your private attributes/variables.</li>
  <li>Create a separate main method to test the object.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Advantages of Encapsulation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Provides code security through data hiding.</li>
  <li>Reusability.</li>
  <li>Flexibility (Read-only or Write-only).</li>
</ol>
